### **Project Description: Application – MVP Phase**

**My Role:**  
As a **tester** (on a volunteer basis), I joined the project at the pre-production stage, after 8 months of development work. My main task is to test the application in its early MVP version, which is expected to be released in the coming months. I support the team in identifying defects, analyzing functionalities, and preparing the application for future automated testing.

### **Responsibilities:**  
1. **Application Testing:**
   - **Exploratory Testing** – I planned exploratory tests focusing on the most important functionalities of the application, such as: registration, login, creating and editing profiles, calendar, scheduling meetings, searching for mentors, subscription, payments, creating mentoring plans, and newsletters.
   - **Manual Testing** – I perform manual testing mainly for functionality, usability, localization, and responsiveness tests. Additionally, I conduct integration tests on the API and basic penetration tests (SQL injection, XXS, JS injection).
   - **API Testing** – I have developed API tests to automatically detect regressions in two main application endpoints, which are particularly susceptible to changes.

2. **Testing Process:**
   - The testing was based on the **black-box method**, where I developed test scenarios covering the entire process of registration, login, connecting accounts to Stripe, profile updates, scheduling, and creating mentoring sessions.
   - I identified and reported numerous **defects** affecting the application's stability, some of which need to be fixed before the MVP release. The reported defects led to regressions, preventing the application from being released as scheduled.
   - **Defect Prioritization** – In collaboration with the team, I helped establish which defects should be fixed before the release, and which ones could be addressed later in the maintenance phase.

3. **Tools Used in the Project:**
   - **Postman** – API testing.
   - **GitHub** – Project management and defect tracking.
   - **DevTools** – Responsiveness testing and inspecting app elements.
   - **Discord** – Communication with the team to quickly resolve issues.
   - **GitHub** – Used for project management, defect reporting, and tracking.

4. **Challenges Encountered in the Project:**
   - **Late Project Onboarding** – I joined the team at a late stage of the application's development, which required quickly familiarizing myself with its features, history, and the ongoing dynamic changes in the code. At this time, the app was undergoing frequent modifications, which caused constant regressions.
   - **Dynamic Changes in the Application** – The app was undergoing intensive changes, and testing was limited mainly to unit and integration tests carried out by developers. Thanks to my fresh perspective, I was able to discover a series of defects that would have impacted the app’s performance after release.
   - **Issues with API Endpoints** – Two key API endpoints are unstable, resulting in regular regression problems. The introduction of API testing allows for quicker detection of these issues.
   - **Lack of Comprehensive Documentation** – Due to frequent changes in the app, the lack of comprehensive documentation made it difficult to test and analyze functionalities quickly.

5. **Future Plans:**
   - After the MVP release, I plan to **develop automated tests** to enable faster and more efficient regression testing.
   - I will also focus on completing the API tests and further improving the testing process to accelerate the next stages of the project.
   - I also plan to **test the full version of the app**, including integration with external systems, and expand the scope of automated testing as the application evolves.

6. **Communication with the Team:**  
   - **Discord** – Regular communication with the team enables quick resolution of issues and discussions on ongoing project matters.
   - **GitHub** – Primarily used for reporting and tracking defects, as well as managing the project.
   - **Meetings** – Organizing meetings to discuss changes in the project, including identifying new defects and setting priorities.

### **Summary:**  
Thanks to my fresh perspective on the application, I was able to identify and fix a number of defects that could have impacted the application's stability. Although the application was not released on schedule, my work has contributed to improving the quality of the app before its public MVP release. Working in the MVP phase allowed me to gain valuable experience in defect prioritization and managing risk, particularly when time and resources are limited. I'm pleased to be part of this project, which has a real impact on the app's development.
